Unnamed English Abugida
===
I've made an abugida for English. I'm open to any suggestions or constructive criticism.

Also, [here](https://github.com/JactusTheCactus/conscript-font-gen.git)'s the project on GitHub & the [font](https://github.com/JactusTheCactus/conscript-font-gen/raw/refs/heads/main/abugidaR.otf) if anyone wants to take a look at it.

For anyone with a keyboard without the special characters, the semicolon (`;`) works as a modifier

| In   | Out |
|------|-----|
| `E;` | `É` |
| `I;` | `Í` |
| `O;` | `Ó` |
| `U;` | `Ú` |
| `D;` | `Ð` |
| `N;` | `Ŋ` |
| `S;` | `Ś` |
| `T;` | `Þ` |
| `Z;` | `Ź` |

The script is Unicameral, so there is no "Uppercase" or "Lowercase." Typing the uppercase and lowercase versions of a character will output the same symbol
