				<td class="Latin">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.<br />
					I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br />
					The evil that men do lives after them;<br />
					The good is oft interrèd with their bones —<br />
					So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br />
					Hath told you Caesar was ambitious.<br />
					If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br />
					And grievously hath Caesar answered it.<br />
					Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest —<br />
					For Brutus is an honorable man;<br />
					So are they all, all honorable men —<br />
					Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.<br />
					He was my friend, faithful and just to me.<br />
					But Brutus says he was ambitious,<br />
					And Brutus is an honorable man.<br />
					He hath brought many captives home to Rome,<br />
					Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.<br />
					Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br />
					When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;<br />
					Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.<br />
					Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br />
					And Brutus is an honorable man.<br />
					You all did see that on the Lupercal<br />
					I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br />
					Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?<br />
					Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,<br />
					And sure he is an honorable man.<br />
					I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br />
					But here I am to speak what I do know.<br />
					You all did love him once, not without cause;<br />
					What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?<br />
					O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br />
					And men have lost their reason! Bear with me;<br />
					My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br />
					And I must pause till it come back to me.</td>
